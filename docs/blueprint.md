# **App Name**: RetroSite

## Core Features:

- Desktop Environment: Simulate the classic Windows 98 desktop environment as the portfolio's main interface.
- Clickable Folders: Use folder icons on the desktop that, when clicked, navigate to different project categories or sections of the portfolio. Offer animated transitions, such as window minimizing/maximizing, for a true retro feel.
- Retro UI Elements: Incorporate elements like a retro start menu (for navigation), a system tray (for contact info or settings), and error message pop-ups (as playful easter eggs).
- Portfolio Windows: Present portfolio projects in dedicated 'window' interfaces that open when a folder is accessed, providing descriptions, images, and links.
- AI Recommendation Easter Egg: An Easter egg page powered by AI will use a tool to suggest which random project in your portfolio the visitor might want to explore based on their browsing habits and interaction time on the website.

## Style Guidelines:

- Predominantly dark themes with customizable window color schemes (classic Windows options). Accent color should be Teal (#008080) for folder highlights
- Utilize classic, pixelated fonts reminiscent of the era.
- Classic Windows 98 style icons.
- Mimic the layout and proportions of the Windows 98 desktop, including taskbar and window arrangements.
- Recreate animations from Windows 98, such as window minimizing, maximizing, and the 'busy' mouse cursor.
