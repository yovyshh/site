This directory is intended for sound files.

To enable click sounds in the application, please:
1. Create or find a click sound effect (e.g., a short '.mp3' file).
2. Name this file 'click.mp3'.
3. Place it in this 'public/sounds/' directory.

The application will then automatically use '/sounds/click.mp3' for button clicks.
You can find free sound effects on websites like freesound.org or similar.
Ensure the sound is web-friendly and not too large for quick loading.
